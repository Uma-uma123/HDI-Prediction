# 🌍 Human Development Index (HDI) Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Human Development Index (HDI) Prediction** project is a Machine Learning-based web application developed to predict the Human Development Index (HDI) category of a country using key socioeconomic indicators.

The application predicts whether a country belongs to one of the following HDI categories:

- 🟢 Very High
- 🔵 High
- 🟡 Medium
- 🔴 Low

The prediction is based on four important development indicators:

- Life Expectancy
- Expected Years of Schooling
- Mean Years of Schooling
- Gross Income Per Capita

The trained Machine Learning model is deployed using the **Flask** framework and provides predictions through an interactive web interface.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Evaluating a country's Human Development Index (HDI) requires analyzing multiple socioeconomic indicators related to health, education, and income. Manual analysis is time-consuming and requires statistical expertise.

This project develops a Machine Learning-based prediction system that classifies countries into HDI categories using development indicators and provides quick predictions through a Flask web application.

---

# 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an HDI prediction model using Machine Learning.
- Analyze Human Development data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Compare multiple Machine Learning algorithms.
- Deploy the best-performing model using Flask.
- Provide a simple and user-friendly prediction interface.
